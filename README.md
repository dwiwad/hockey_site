## Goals

- üìä Static blog-style analysis of NHL teams, players, games, and historical trends
- üñ•  Live game dashboards using the NHL API that track the "shape of the game" with my novel metrics of Depth, Physicality, Defensive Success, etc.
- üìÅ Separate pages for:
	- Blog Posts (static analyses)
	- Live Dashboards
	- Team and player stat lookups
	- About me

## Status

As of 06/26/2026 this project is in extremely early development. Currently focused on design and standing up the skeleton.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python for backend code and data analysis. Maybe some R if it plays nicely together  (FastAPI for backend)
- HTML/CSS/JS for front end (Jinja2)
